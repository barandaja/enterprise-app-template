# Auth Service Monitoring Recommendations

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive monitoring recommendations for the Enterprise Auth Service to ensure security, performance, and compliance requirements are met.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### 1. Security Metrics

#### Authentication Metrics
- **Failed login attempts** per user/IP (threshold: >5 in 30 minutes)
- **Account lockouts** (alert on spike)
- **Password reset requests** (detect potential account takeover)
- **Suspicious login patterns** (new location, device, time)
- **JWT token validation failures** (potential attack indicator)

```yaml
# Prometheus alert example
- alert: HighFailedLoginRate
  expr: rate(auth_failed_login_total[5m]) > 0.1
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "High failed login rate detected"
    description: "Failed login rate is {{ $value }} per second"
```

#### Encryption Metrics
- **Encryption/decryption errors** (should be near zero)
- **Key rotation events** (track for compliance)
- **PII access patterns** (audit trail)

### 2. Performance Metrics

#### Database Connection Pool
- **Active connections** (target: <70% of pool size)
- **Connection wait time** (target: <100ms)
- **Connection timeouts** (alert on any)
- **Query execution time** (p95 <50ms, p99 <200ms)

```yaml
# Monitoring query for connection pool
SELECT 
  datname,
  count(*) as connections,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'active') as active,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'idle') as idle,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'idle in transaction') as idle_in_transaction,
  max(EXTRACT(epoch FROM (now() - query_start))) as longest_query_seconds
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = 'authdb'
GROUP BY datname;
```

#### Redis Performance
- **Connection pool utilization** (target: <70%)
- **Command latency** (p95 <5ms)
- **Memory usage** (alert at 80%)
- **Eviction rate** (should be zero for session store)

#### API Response Times
- **Login endpoint**: p95 <200ms, p99 <500ms
- **Token validation**: p95 <50ms, p99 <100ms
- **User lookup**: p95 <100ms, p99 <200ms

### 3. Rate Limiting Metrics

Monitor rate limit violations by endpoint:
- **Login endpoint violations** (normal: <1% of requests)
- **API endpoint violations** (normal: <0.1% of requests)
- **Per-user rate limit hits** (identify potential abuse)
- **Global rate limit hits** (DDoS indicator)

### 4. Compliance Metrics

#### Audit Log Monitoring
- **Audit log write failures** (must be zero)
- **Sensitive data access frequency** (track patterns)
- **Data retention policy violations** (automated cleanup)
- **Compliance report generation time** (should be <5 minutes)

#### GDPR/HIPAA Specific
- **Data access requests** (response time tracking)
- **Data deletion requests** (completion tracking)
- **Consent changes** (audit trail)
- **Encryption key usage** (for key rotation planning)

## Recommended Monitoring Stack

### 1. Metrics Collection
```yaml
# Prometheus configuration
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'auth-service'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
```

### 2. Logging Architecture
```python
# Structured logging configuration
LOGGING_CONFIG = {
    "version": 1,
    "disable_existing_loggers": False,
    "formatters": {
        "json": {
            "class": "pythonjsonlogger.jsonlogger.JsonFormatter",
            "format": "%(asctime)s %(name)s %(levelname)s %(message)s"
        }
    },
    "handlers": {
        "default": {
            "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
            "formatter": "json"
        }
    },
    "root": {
        "level": "INFO",
        "handlers": ["default"]
    }
}
```

### 3. Distributed Tracing
```python
# OpenTelemetry configuration
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint=settings.OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT,
    insecure=settings.ENVIRONMENT != "production"
)

span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(span_processor)
```

## Alert Configuration

### Critical Alerts (Page immediately)
1. **Service Down**: Auth service unreachable for >1 minute
2. **Database Connection Failure**: Cannot connect to primary database
3. **Encryption Key Access Failure**: Cannot access encryption keys
4. **High Error Rate**: Error rate >5% for 5 minutes
5. **Security Breach Indicators**: Multiple failed decryption attempts

### Warning Alerts (Notify on-call)
1. **High Response Time**: p95 latency >1s for 10 minutes
2. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: >90% pool utilization
3. **Rate Limit Spike**: 10x normal rate limit violations
4. **Certificate Expiry**: SSL certificates expiring in <30 days
5. **Disk Space**: <20% free space on database or application servers

### Info Alerts (Dashboard/daily report)
1. **Daily Active Users**: Track growth trends
2. **Authentication Success Rate**: Should be >95%
3. **API Usage Patterns**: Identify optimization opportunities
4. **Password Reset Frequency**: Security awareness indicator

## Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Set Meaningful SLOs**
   - 99.9% uptime (allows 43 minutes downtime/month)
   - 95% of requests under 200ms
   - Zero security breaches
   - 100% audit log capture

2. **Implement Error Budgets**
   - Track SLO violations
   - Automate incident creation
   - Regular SLO reviews

3. **Automate Response**
   ```python
   # Example: Auto-scale on high load
   if cpu_usage > 80 and response_time_p95 > 500:
       scale_up_instances()
   ```

4. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Weekly failed login analysis
   - Monthly access pattern review
   - Quarterly penetration testing
   - Annual compliance audit

5. **Capacity Planning**
   - Track growth trends
   - Project 6-month capacity needs
   - Plan for 2x peak load
   - Regular load testing

## Incident Response Playbooks

### 1. High Failed Login Rate
1. Check for distributed attack patterns
2. Identify affected accounts
3. Enable stricter rate limiting if needed
4. Block suspicious IPs
5. Notify affected users

### 2. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
1. Check for long-running queries
2. Identify connection leaks
3. Restart connection pool if needed
4. Scale database if persistent
5. Review connection pool sizing

### 3. Encryption Service Failure
1. Verify key management service status
2. Check for key rotation issues
3. Fail over to backup keys if available
4. Initiate incident response team
5. Prepare security breach notifications
