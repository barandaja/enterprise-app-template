# Enterprise Application Template

A secure, compliant, and scalable template for building enterprise applications with Python/FastAPI microservices, React frontend, and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure.

## 🚀 Features

- **Complete Application Independence**: Each app forks this template and operates independently
- **Enterprise Security**: JWT authentication, field-level encryption, comprehensive audit logging
- **Compliance Ready**: Built-in GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2 compliance features
- **Microservices Architecture**: FastAPI services with Istio service mesh
- **Modern Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- **Cloud Native**: Kubernetes-ready with GKE Autopilot support
- **Developer Experience**: CLI tools, local development setup, comprehensive testing

## 📋 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/enterprise-app-template.git my-app
cd my-app

# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-new-app.sh --name my-app --team my-team

# Start local development
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh --all
```

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

- **GDPR**: Data subject rights, consent management, data portability
- **HIPAA**: PHI protection, audit trails, emergency access
- **SOC2**: Security monitoring, incident response, vendor management
- **Security**: Zero-trust architecture, encryption at rest/transit, comprehensive logging

## 📊 Technical Debt Tracking

We maintain transparency about known issues and improvements:

- **[TECHNICAL_DEBT.md](./TECHNICAL_DEBT.md)**: Comprehensive tracking of all technical debt
- **Service-specific TODOs**: Each service has a `TODO.md` file
- **GitHub Issues**: Use the `technical-debt` label for tracking

### Priority Levels
- 🔴 **Critical**: Must fix before production
- 🟡 **High**: Should fix soon
- 🟢 **Low**: Nice to have

### Current Status
- Total Items: 7
- Critical: 0
- High Priority: 5
- Low Priority: 2

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Fork the Template**: Each application starts by forking this template
2. **Configure**: Update configuration for your specific needs
3. **Develop**: Add your business logic and services
4. **Test**: Comprehensive test suites included
5. **Deploy**: Production-ready CI/CD pipelines
